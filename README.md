This is a project that illustrates the use of both breadth-first search and depth-first search algorithms.

A mapping was done to link up city locations using the shortest train station routes.

I learnt a lot about Graphs traversal and the BFS and DFS search algorithms, while working on this.

This was fun. ðŸ˜Š
